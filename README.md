This is Wiba!!

This small application aims to find the time of any racer of the current track of the ZakStunts championship and apply the coefficients of the other available cars. Basically, the application scrapes the site to fetch the information and applies the calculations to display the corresponding times on the screen. I left a compiled version that runs in Windows. Special thanks to Duplode and Alan Rotoi who helped me in the process of creating this tool.
